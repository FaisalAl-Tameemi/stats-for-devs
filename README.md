# Practical Statistics for Software Engineers

This repository supports the series of articles on medium about useful statistical concepts for working on data science projects.

The repository contains the following:

* Code snippets used in blog posts
* Jupyter notebooks for each post
* The datasets referenced in each post


## Requirements

* Python 2.7+
* Pandas



## Data 

The data contains information about 395 students and the outcome for each student (passed or not).

Other than the `passed` column, each student has 30 columns of data about them, including features such as family size (`famsize`) and study time (`studytime`).

[See the data here](/data/student-data.csv)



## Code

The code used in the blog posts can be found in the [/scripts](/scripts) directory.

You can run the code for Part 1 by running the following command:

```
python ./scripts/part_1.py
```
